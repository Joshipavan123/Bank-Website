How to Use EMI Calculator?</h2><br><pre>
With colourful charts and instant results, our EMI Calculator is easy to use, intuitive to understand and is quick
to perform. You can calculate EMI for home loan, car loan, personal loan, education loan or any other fully amortizing loan using this calculator.

Enter the following information in the EMI Calculator:

Principal loan amount you wish to avail (rupees)
Loan term (months or years)
Rate of interest (percentage)
EMI in advance OR EMI in arrears (for car loan only)
Use the slider to adjust the values in the EMI calculator form. If you need to enter more precise values, you can
type the values directly in the relevant boxes provided above. As soon as the values are changed using the slider
(or hit the 'tab' key after entering the values directly in the input fields), EMI calculator will re-calculate your monthly payment (EMI) amount.

A pie chart depicting the break-up of total payment (i.e., total principal vs. total interest payable) 
is also displayed. It displays the percentage of total interest versus principal amount in the sum total of all 
payments made against the loan. The payment schedule table showing payments made every month / year for the 
entire loan duration is displayed along with a chart showing interest and principal components paid each year. 
A portion of each payment is for the interest while the remaining amount is applied towards the principal balance.
During initial loan period, a large portion of each payment is devoted to interest. With passage of time, larger
portions pay down the principal. The payment schedule also shows the intermediate outstanding balance for each
year which will be carried over to the next year.</pre>
